# Resign Button Functionality Test

## Test Steps

1. **Navigate to Demo Page**
   - Go to http://localhost:3002/demo
   - Verify the chess board loads correctly
   - Verify the resign button is visible below the board

2. **Test Resign Button Visibility**
   - Confirm the resign button appears when `gameStatus === 'active'`
   - Confirm the button has a red border and flag icon
   - Confirm the button text says "Resign"

3. **Test Resign Functionality**
   - Click the "Resign" button
   - Verify a confirmation dialog appears asking "Are you sure you want to resign? This will end the game."
   - Click "OK" to confirm resignation
   - Verify the following happens:
     - Game status changes to 'completed'
     - Game over overlay appears
     - Resignation message shows: "[Player] resigned! [Winner] wins!"
     - Resign button disappears (since game is no longer active)
     - "New Game" button appears in the overlay

4. **Test Game Reset After Resignation**
   - Click "New Game" button in the overlay
   - Verify the game resets to initial state
   - Verify the resign button reappears
   - Verify game status returns to 'active'

## Expected Behavior

### Before Resignation:
- Game status: 'active'
- Resign button: Visible
- Game over overlay: Hidden
- Current turn indicator: Shows whose turn it is

### After Resignation:
- Game status: 'completed'
- Resign button: Hidden
- Game over overlay: Visible with resignation message
- Winner: Set to the player who didn't resign
- resignedBy: Set to the player who resigned

### After Reset:
- Game returns to initial state
- All resignation data cleared
- Game ready for new play

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Enhanced Resignation Message**: Improved the resignation message format for better clarity
2. **Added Confirmation Dialog**: Added a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental resignations
3. **Verified Game State Logic**: Ensured the `isGameOver` logic properly includes resignation (`gameState.gameStatus === 'completed'`)
4. **Proper State Management**: Verified that resignation properly sets:
   - `gameStatus: 'completed'`
   - `winner: [opposite player]`
   - `resignedBy: [current player]`
   - `isPlayerTurn: false`

## Code Changes Made

1. **ChessBoard.tsx**: Added confirmation dialog to resign button
2. **ChessBoard.tsx**: Enhanced resignation message formatting
3. **useChessGame.ts**: Verified resignation logic is correct (no changes needed)

The resign functionality should now work correctly in demo mode with proper user feedback and confirmation.
