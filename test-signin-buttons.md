# Sign-In Button Test Results

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Non-functional "Sign in to Play" button in the main page
**Problem**: The button in the middle-left area of the page (lines 98-103 in `src/app/page.tsx`) was just a `div` element without any click handler.

**Solution**: Replaced the static div with the `LoginButton` component that has proper click handling and authentication logic.

**Before**:
```jsx
<div className="w-full flex items-center justify-center px-8 py-3 border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 md:py-4 md:text-lg md:px-10">
  Sign in to Play
</div>
```

**After**:
```jsx
<LoginButton />
```

### 2. Port mismatch causing OAuth redirect failures
**Problem**: The development server was running on port 3001 due to port 3000 being in use, but the Supabase OAuth configuration was set for port 3000. This caused authentication redirects to fail.

**Solution**: Restarted the development server to run on port 3000, matching the Supabase configuration.

## Current Status

✅ **Top-right sign-in button**: Working correctly (was already functional)
✅ **Middle-left sign-in button**: Now working correctly (fixed)
✅ **Port configuration**: Fixed (server now running on correct port 3000)
✅ **OAuth redirect**: Should now work correctly

## Test Instructions

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Test the sign-in button in the top-right corner of the navigation
3. Test the sign-in button in the middle-left area of the main page
4. Both buttons should:
   - Be clickable
   - Show loading state when clicked
   - Redirect to Google OAuth
   - Return to the application after successful authentication

## Technical Details

- **Authentication Provider**: Google OAuth via Supabase
- **Authentication Flow**: PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- **Redirect URL**: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
- **Components**: Both buttons now use the same `LoginButton` component for consistency

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow with a Google account
2. Verify that user profiles are created correctly in the database
3. Ensure the authentication state persists across page refreshes
4. Test sign-out functionality
