## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Columns in `games` table:

- `action` - 'play_again' or 'leave'
- `created_at` - Timestamp

### New Database Functions:

- `cleanup_old_completed_games()` - Function to clean up old games

### New Indexes:
- `idx_games_completed_at` - For efficient cleanup queries
- `idx_post_game_actions_game_id` - For post-game action lookups
- `idx_post_game_actions_player_id` - For user action lookups

## 🔄 User Flow

### Game Completion Flow:
1. Game ends (checkmate/resignation/draw)
2. Database automatically updated with result
3. PostGameActions component appears
4. Players choose "Play Again" or "Leave"
5. Actions synchronized in real-time
6. Appropriate navigation occurs

### Play Again Flow:
1. Both players click "Play Again"
2. New game created with swapped colors
3. Both players redirected to new game
4. Old game remains in completed state

### Leave Game Flow:

### Cleanup Flow:
1. Automatic cleanup runs every 5 minutes
2. Waiting games older than 30 minutes → abandoned
3. Completed games older than 7 days (both players left) → deleted
4. Manual cleanup available in development

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Installations:
1. Use the updated `supabase-schema.sql` or `setup-games-table.sql`
2. No additional steps needed

### For Existing Installations:
1. Run `post-game-actions-migration.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Verify real-time is enabled for `post_game_actions` table
3. Test the functionality using `test-post-game-features.md`

## 🧪 Testing

Use the comprehensive test guide in `test-post-game-features.md` to verify:
- Game completion detection
- Post-game UI functionality
- Play again mechanics
- Leave game functionality
- Real-time synchronization
- Cleanup systems

## 🔧 Configuration

### Cleanup Timing:
- Waiting game timeout: 30 minutes (configurable via `WAITING_GAME_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`)
- Completed game cleanup: 7 days (configurable in cleanup function)
- Cleanup interval: 5 minutes

### Real-time:
- Post-game actions use real-time subscriptions
- Automatic fallback to polling if real-time fails
- Connection monitoring and retry logic
